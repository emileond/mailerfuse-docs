## What is Mailerfuse?
Mailerfuse is a powerful email verification service designed to help you ensure the validity of your email lists. Whether you're cleaning up your subscriber list, improving deliverability, or reducing bounce rates, Mailerfuse provides accurate and reliable email verification, similar to ZeroBounce.

Each email validation deducts **one credit**, so make sure you have enough credits in your account before making requests.

## Getting an API Key

Mailerfuse uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can generate an API key through the [Mailerfuse Dashboard](https://mailerfuse.com/keys).

## Authentication

To authenticate API requests, include your key in the `x-api-key` header:

<Warning>
    Your API key is a **secret** and should be stored securelyâ€”never expose it in public repositories or frontend code.
</Warning>

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.mailerfuse.com/email/verify" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{ "email": "test@example.com" }'
```
